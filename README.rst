Proxmark
========

This is a little python tool that is able to communicate with the Proxmark3 (http://www.proxmark.org/). It is just a proof of conecpt, build because the native C client sucks like hell. Antenna tuning is already implemented and it is also possible to dump data from rfid chips. It has never been finished but maybe someone will find this useful
